# Deprecated Migration Directory

**Canonical migration directory:** `backend/supabase/migrations/`

All migrations have been consolidated into `backend/supabase/migrations/`.
New migrations should be created there, not here.

This directory is kept for backward compatibility with existing deploy scripts
but should not be used for new work.
