"""Skill context manager for token budget control.

This module provides context building and token management for multi-skill orchestration:
- Token budget constants for orchestrator and subagent contexts
- Context allocation tracking
- Compact summary generation for handoffs
- Token estimation and compaction utilities

The context manager ensures ARIA stays within token limits while maintaining
effective skill coordination through minimal but sufficient context.
