## Instructions

Produce a single-page briefing document with these sections:

1. **Meeting Context** — Who, what, when, where, and the stated agenda or purpose. Note any previous meetings and their outcomes.

2. **Attendee Profiles** — For each expected attendee: name, title, priorities, communication style preferences, and relationship history. Flag any new contacts.

3. **Account Pulse** — Current deal stage, health score, last meaningful interaction, and any open action items from prior engagements.

4. **Key Talking Points** — 3-5 prioritized discussion topics based on recent signals, stakeholder interests, and strategic objectives. Include supporting data points.

5. **Questions to Ask** — 3-4 targeted questions to advance the relationship or uncover critical information gaps.

6. **Watch-Outs** — Potential sensitivities, competitor mentions to avoid or address, and any recent negative signals to be aware of.

7. **Desired Outcomes** — Specific, measurable objectives for this meeting (e.g., "Confirm budget timeline", "Secure intro to VP Engineering").

Keep the tone crisp and scannable. This should be digestible in under 2 minutes. Include "meeting_one_pager" as the template in metadata.
