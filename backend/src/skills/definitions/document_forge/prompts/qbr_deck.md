4. **Account Health Summary** — Overview of top accounts by health score, accounts at risk, and accounts showing growth signals.

5. **Competitive Win/Loss Analysis** — Key competitive encounters, win rate by competitor, and lessons learned.

6. **Stakeholder Engagement Metrics** — Meeting frequency, response rates, multi-threading depth across top accounts.

7. **Next Quarter Outlook** — Pipeline coverage ratio, forecasted revenue, key deals to watch, and confidence assessment.

8. **Strategic Priorities** — Top 3-5 priorities for next quarter with specific actions, owners, and success criteria.
