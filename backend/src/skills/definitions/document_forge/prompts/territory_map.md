## Instructions

Produce a territory analysis document with the following sections:

1. **Territory Overview** — Geographic and/or segment boundaries, total addressable market, and current penetration rate.

2. **Account Segmentation** — Accounts categorized by tier (Strategic, Growth, Maintain, Develop) with criteria for each tier and count/revenue breakdown.

3. **Pipeline Distribution** — Pipeline value and stage distribution across the territory. Identify concentration risks (too much pipeline in one account or segment).

4. **White Space Analysis** — Untapped accounts or segments with high potential. Include rationale for prioritization based on firmographic fit, intent signals, and competitive gaps.

5. **Coverage Assessment** — Current rep-to-account ratios, engagement frequency by tier, and accounts with insufficient coverage. Recommend coverage adjustments.

6. **Growth Signals** — Accounts showing expansion signals (hiring, funding, regulatory changes, new product launches) that warrant increased attention.

7. **Risk Concentrations** — Accounts at risk of churn or downsell, deals slipping, and competitive threats by sub-territory.

8. **90-Day Action Plan** — Prioritized list of territory actions: accounts to penetrate, relationships to deepen, deals to accelerate, and coverage gaps to close.

9. **Quota Attainment Trajectory** — Current attainment vs. plan, required run-rate for remainder of period, and scenario analysis (base/upside/downside).

Where territory-specific data is unavailable, flag with "[Requires territory data integration]". Include "territory_map" as the template in metadata.
