## Instructions

Produce a competitive battle card with the following sections:

1. **Competitor Snapshot** — Company overview, market position, recent funding/acquisitions, and strategic direction. Include any known leadership changes.

2. **Product Comparison** — Feature-by-feature comparison matrix covering key capabilities. Use ✓/✗/~ (partial) indicators. Focus on differentiators that matter to life sciences buyers.

3. **Pricing & Packaging** — Known pricing model, typical deal sizes, and how their packaging compares. Note any aggressive discounting patterns.

4. **Strengths to Acknowledge** — Areas where the competitor genuinely excels. Being honest here builds rep credibility.

5. **Weaknesses to Exploit** — Specific gaps, limitations, or customer pain points. Include proof points (customer quotes, analyst reports, case studies) where available.

6. **Common Objections & Rebuttals** — Top 5 objections reps hear when competing, with tested rebuttal frameworks. Use the format: Objection → Reframe → Proof Point.

7. **Landmine Questions** — Questions a rep can ask the prospect that expose competitor weaknesses naturally, without being overtly negative.

8. **Win Strategies** — Situational playbooks: "If the competitor is already incumbent...", "If this is a greenfield evaluation...", "If the prospect mentions [competitor feature]...".

9. **Recent Win/Loss Intelligence** — Patterns from recent competitive deals, including what swung outcomes in our favor or theirs.

Keep language punchy and sales-ready — reps will reference this during live calls. Include "battle_card" as the template in metadata.
