Hi Rob,
Perfect. Two weeks gives you good time to review with leadership and evaluate everything properly.
March 1st kickoff timeline works well on our end. I'll keep that week of March 8th open for our follow-up discussion once you've had a chance to go through everything with your team.
Let me know if any questions come up during your review process.
Best,
Dhruv

## Recommendations

All drafts passed quality checks. The pipeline is ready for the board demo.

**Pre-demo checklist:**
- [ ] Verify Outlook drafts appear in Dhruv's drafts folder
- [ ] Open 2-3 drafts side-by-side with originals to verify quality live
- [ ] Prepare talking points about context gathering (7 sources)
- [ ] Have backup emails ready in case inbox is quiet on demo day
